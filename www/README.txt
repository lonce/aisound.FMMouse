A demo of how to use jsaSounds in browsers. 

Note that sounds are "served" from animatedsoundworks.com (so you must be connected to the web). 

=======================================================
If you want to use a local sound model: 

First copy folders from jsaSound to your working directory:
   jsaCore/
   jsaModels/

uncomment the require.config path "jsaSound" member to refer to the local path rather than to animatedsoundworks.com 

Then run.
